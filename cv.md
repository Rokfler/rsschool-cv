Additional information
About me	- At my last job, I participated in meetings about frontend development. It was that time when I realized that it would be interesting for me and very useful to learn the technical aspects of development, and to develop myself further in this direction.
- I proposed the idea of introducing parsing of client sites, creating a common database and conducting data analysis to simplify the workflow processes of the Content Department. PoC was used to demonstrate the efficiency of this idea. According to the results, all of the above went into production.
- Analyzed competitors' products and collected feedback from customers to improve the appearance of the company's website and request forms. As a result of the feedback, we have significantly changed the appearance of our products.
